#üêç Python Data Structures: Mastering Lists, Sets, and Dictionaries

Developed a Python project showcasing proficiency with core data structures, including Lists, Sets, and Dictionaries. Demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities through:

List Operations: Implemented efficient methods for adding, updating, and removing elements while leveraging list comprehensions for clean, Pythonic code.
Set Manipulation: Utilized sets for fast membership testing and unique data management, including operations like unions, intersections, and differences.
Dictionary Management: Built dynamic and versatile data models using dictionaries, showcasing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with practical use cases.
This project underscores my ability to write clean, maintainable code and my understanding of fundamental data management techniques‚Äîessential skills for any software development or data-driven role.
